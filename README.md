### Hello and welcome to my humble repository 🙋‍♂️

Here I put my contributions to the python code space to create something unique out of ideas 
and the mysterious patterns that god had left for us to explore ... 🕵️‍♂️

🧘‍♂️ Coding and meditation go hand in hand. It requires full attention and awareness of all things flowing from the head to the hands.
